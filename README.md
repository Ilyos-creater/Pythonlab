# Python Craft Lab

Hands-on Python projects with test-first learning and clean tooling.  
**Rule:** AI gives me tasks to solve or I find them myself; I must implement them **myself**. I may use AI **only** for feedback and to understand concepts â€” **no solutions**.

## Goals
- Think like a Pythonista: readable, small, composable code  
- Build real tools (CLIs, APIs, parsers) and ship them  
- Quality by default: pytest, ruff/black, mypy
- Become a more proficient DevOps-Engineer and learning how to use Python
